Qubecloud is a side project I have been working on that aims to make Minecraft server deployment a breeze.

I primarily used it as a way to improve my knowledge about containerized services and Kubernetes. Each server can be deployed in isolation using dynamically configured Dockerfiles.

Currently, I am using Google Compute Engine to run the docker containers, but with minor effort, this can be changed to run on a full Kubernetes environment. Finding the correct balance as it scales from a few servers to potentially hundreds is why I am starting with CE and will later move to K8s.

* Angular 10 Web Application
* [Nebular](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/) Component Library
* Firebase - Auth, Cloud Functions and Firestore Database
* Docker - WebApp talks to a seperate backend service to configure and build a Minecraft Server Dockerfile
* Google Compute Engine for Dockerized VM Server Deployments
* Paddle Payment Integration

### Server Creation

The first step in a three-step process when setting up a new server. The plan you choose essentially decides the resources available to your server.

The second step is the main part of the process. Here you provided a name for your server as well as what version and/or modpack to deploy.

The final step is a summary screen and payment screen.

### Server Details

This is a detailed view of a server. You can track CPU and ram server load, monitor the Minecraft server logs, as well as update any server-specific configuration.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
